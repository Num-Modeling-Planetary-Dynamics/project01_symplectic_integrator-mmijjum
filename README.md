# Project 1 - Write your own symplectic integrator
###### *Due: Friday, Oct. 14, 2022 by 5:00pm*

Symplectic Integrator

Does not run, but I attempted the following: 
- Separate heliocentric drift, kick, and keplerian drift functions
- a for loop that iterates over each of these, using the updates from the function before it to yield new rvectors and vvectors
- final energy calculations using the updated r/vvectors
